[.lead]
Monitor and track the execution of FSx for ONTAP operations and monitor job progress with Tracker in NetApp Console.

.About this task 
NetApp Console provides Tracker, a job monitoring feature, so you can monitor and track the progress and status of credentials, FSx for ONTAP, and link operations, review details for operation tasks and subtasks, and diagnose any issues or failures.

Several actions are available in Tracker. You can filter jobs by time frame (last 24 hours, 7 days, 14 days, or 30 days), workload, status, and user; find jobs using the search function; and download the jobs table as a CSV file. You can refresh Tracker at any time. And you can quickly retry a failed operation or edit parameters for a failed operation and try the operation again. 

Tracker supports two levels of monitoring depending on the operation. Each task, such as file system deployment, displays the task description, status, start time, task duration, user, region, proxy resource, task ID, and all related sub tasks. You can view API responses to understand what happened during the operation.

Tracker task levels with examples::: 

* Level 1 (parent task): Tracks file system deployment.
* Level 2 (sub task): Tracks the sub tasks related to file system deployment. 

Operation status:::
Operation status in Tracker is as follows _in progress_, _success_, and _failed_.

Operation frequency:::
Operation frequency is based on the task type and schedule.

Events retention:::
Events are retained in the user interface for 30 days.
