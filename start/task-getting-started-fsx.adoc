Get started with Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP in the NetApp Console by adding credentials, creating a Console agent or link, and by creating or discovering a file system.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Adding AWS credentials is required to provide the NetApp Console with the permissions needed to create and manage FSx for ONTAP file systems. You can choose between _read-only_ and _read/write_ permissions.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
To perform some management tasks from the NetApp Console, you either need a Console agent or a NetApp Workloads link. A _Console agent_ is a virtual machine that you deploy in your VPC to manage your FSx for ONTAP file systems. A _link_ leverages AWS Lambda to create a trust relationship and connectivity to your FSx for ONTAP file systems.
