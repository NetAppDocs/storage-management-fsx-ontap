link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/what-is-fsx-ontap.html[Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP^] is a fully managed service allowing customers to launch and run file systems powered by the NetApp ONTAP storage operating system. FSx for ONTAP provides the same features, performance, and administrative capabilities NetApp customers use on premises, with the simplicity, agility, security, and scalability of a native AWS service.

== NetApp Console
 
Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP management is accessible through the NetApp Console.
 
The NetApp Console provides centralized management of NetApp storage and data services across on-premises and cloud environments at enterprise grade. The Console is required to access and use NetApp data services. As a management interface, it enables you to manage many storage resources from one interface. Console administrators can control access to storage and services for all systems within the enterprise.
 
You don't need a license or subscription to start using NetApp Console and you only incur charges when you need to deploy Console agents in your cloud to ensure connectivity to your storage systems or NetApp data services. However, some NetApp data services accessible from the Console are licensed or subscription-based.

Learn more about the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/concept-overview.html[NetApp Console].

== Using FSx for ONTAP from the NetApp Console
From the NetApp Console systems page, you can create and discover FSx for ONTAP systems and use System Manager and other NetApp services. If you want to manage FSx for ONTAP systems and workloads running on Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP, use https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-fsx-ontap/index.html[NetApp Workload Factory^].

== Console agents and links unlock all FSx for ONTAP features
Console agents and links enable connectivity and trust relationships between the NetApp Console and Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP working environments. A Console agent is NetApp software that runs in your cloud or on-premises network, and a link uses AWS Lambda to execute NetApp code. You don't need a Console agent or link to get started in the Console or create FSx for ONTAP systems, but you do need to use a Console agent or link to make full use of FSx for ONTAP features.

You need a Console agent or link to use the following features:

* Well-architected status of FSx for ONTAP file system configurations for proactive maintenance, reliability, and cost-performance optimization
* NetApp Autonomous Ransomware Protection (ARP/AI)
* Enhanced holistic capacity observability across FSx for ONTAP file systems
* Volume and storage VM data replication, management, and monitoring
* SMB/CIFS shares and NFS export policy provisioning and management
* Management of iSCSI volumes on an FSx for ONTAP file system
* Creation and management of snapshot policies for custom protection SLA
* Inode management enhancements for automatic capacity management
* Volume autogrow for elastic scaling
* Clone creation and management, for instant, in-place, data cloning
* Displaying additional metrics directly from ONTAP such as the ONTAP version
