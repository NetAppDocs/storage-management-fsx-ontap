=== NetApp releases additional CloudFormation resources
NetApp now provides CloudFormation resources that allow customers to utilize advanced ONTAP components which are not exposed within the AWS console. CloudFormation is the infrastructure-as-code mechanism for AWS. You'll be able to create replication relationships, CIFS shares, NFS export policies, snapshots, and more.
