=== Associate FSx for ONTAP file system with a workspace in BlueXP
After BlueXP integration in November 2024, newly created FSx for ONTAP file systems were not associated with one workspace in BlueXP. Now when you create or discover FSx for ONTAP file systems, they are associated with one workspace within a BlueXP account. 

If you have existing FSx for ONTAP file systems that are not associated with a workspace, we will help you associate them with a workspace in BlueXP. You can link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-get-help.html#create-a-case-with-netapp-support[create a case with NetApp Support^] from within the BlueXP console. Select *Workload Factory* as the service. 

=== File system removal from BlueXP canvas 
You can now remove an FSx for ONTAP file system from a workspace in the BlueXP canvas. This operation dissociates the file system from one workspace so that you can associate it with another workspace within the same BlueXP account.
